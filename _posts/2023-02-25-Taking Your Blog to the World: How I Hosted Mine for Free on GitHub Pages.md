Hey there! In my last post, I talked about how I created my blog using Jekyll and the Chirpy theme. But, as you may know, having a blog is only half the battle - you need to get it out there for people to see. That's where hosting comes in. In this post, I'm going to share my experience hosting my blog on GitHub Pages, a free and powerful hosting platform offered by GitHub. Whether you're a tech-savvy developer or just starting out with your very first blog, this post is packed with step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and helpful tips to guide you through the process. So, sit tight and get ready to learn how to publish your blog for the world to see, without any server management or infrastructure costs. Let's get started!

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service provided by GitHub, the popular code hosting platform. It allows you to publish a website or blog directly from a GitHub repository, without any server management or infrastructure costs. GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, a static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites and blogs.

GitHub Pages is not only free, but it's also easy to use and comes with a bunch of features that make it an excellent choice for hosting a blog. One of its most significant advantages is that it provides version control with Git, which means you can track changes to your site and collaborate with others more easily. Additionally, GitHub Pages offers custom domain support, HTTPS encryption, and integration with other GitHub services, such as Actions and Projects.

Overall, GitHub Pages is a great option for anyone looking to host a blog or a simple website, whether you're an individual blogger, a small business, or a nonprofit organization. In the next section, we'll walk through the process of setting up GitHub Pages for your blog.
