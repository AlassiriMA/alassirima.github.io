# How to Host a Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages

## Introduction
Congratulations on publishing your first blog post! In your previous post, you shared your experience of creating a Jekyll blog using the Chirpy theme. Now, you want to take the next step and host your blog on GitHub Pages. This post will guide you through the process of hosting your Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages. 

## What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish a website or a blog directly from a GitHub repository. GitHub Pages is an excellent choice for hosting a Jekyll blog because it offers version control, security, and reliability. Moreover, it is easy to set up and customize. 

## Setting Up GitHub Pages
Before you can host your Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages, you need to set up a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Once you have created an account, you can create a new repository to host your Jekyll blog. You can either use the default settings or customize the repository's settings to suit your needs. 

## Preparing Your Jekyll Blog for GitHub Pages
To prepare your Jekyll blog for hosting on GitHub Pages, you need to modify the configuration file of your Jekyll blog. The configuration file is where you specify the settings for your Jekyll blog, such as the title, author, and URL. You also need to add a base URL to your Jekyll blog to ensure that all the links work correctly. After modifying the configuration file, you need to commit and push the changes to GitHub.
## Deploying Your Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages
After you have prepared your Jekyll blog for hosting on GitHub Pages, you can deploy it to GitHub Pages. To do so, you need to enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. You can choose a theme for your Jekyll blog or customize your domain if you want. Finally, you need to push your Jekyll files to GitHub. GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish your Jekyll blog.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Hosting a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages can be straightforward, but sometimes issues may arise. Here are some common issues you may encounter and how to fix them:

- **404 errors**: If you encounter a 404 error when trying to access your Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages, check your base URL and make sure it matches the repository name.
- **Build errors**: If your Jekyll blog fails to build on GitHub Pages, check the build log and fix any errors in your Jekyll code.
- **CSS and JavaScript issues**: If your Jekyll blog looks different on GitHub Pages than it does on your local machine, check the paths of your CSS and JavaScript files and make sure they are correct.
