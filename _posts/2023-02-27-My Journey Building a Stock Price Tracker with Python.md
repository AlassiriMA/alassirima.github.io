As someone who had just completed an advanced Python course on Udemy, I was eager to apply my newfound knowledge to a real-world project. After some research, I decided to build a simple stock price tracker that would retrieve real-time stock prices and display them in a visually appealing format. In this post, I'll share the steps I took to create my first Python application and the challenges I encountered along the way.

## Planning and Preparation
Before diving into the code, I spent time planning and researching the requirements for the project. After identifying the Alpha Vantage API as the best source for real-time stock prices and selecting pandas and matplotlib for data visualization, I installed Python and created a virtual environment. Next, I installed the necessary libraries and began writing the code.

## Writing the Code
I started by writing a script to retrieve stock prices from the Alpha Vantage API and store the data in a pandas dataframe. Using matplotlib, I produced a line graph that displayed the stock prices over time. To make the application more user-friendly, I added input prompts to allow the user to specify the stock symbol and date range. I explained how each section of the code contributed to the overall functionality of the application.
Testing and Debugging:
After completing the basic functionality of the application, I tested it with various stock symbols and date ranges to ensure accurate results. Though I encountered issues with incorrect API calls and missing dependencies, I was able to troubleshoot them using online resources and forums.

## Finalizing the Application:
After testing and debugging, I made final adjustments to the application to improve performance and appearance. I added customization options to the line graph, such as color schemes and font styles, and simplified the code where possible to make it more efficient. Finally, I documented the code logic and API usage for future reference.

## Conclusion:
Building my first Python application was a rewarding experience that taught me a great deal about programming, APIs, and data visualization. By breaking down the project into manageable steps and researching the best tools and libraries, I was able to create a functional and user-friendly stock price tracker. Though I encountered challenges and relied on outside resources to troubleshoot errors, these experiences deepened my understanding of Python and its applications.
Going forward, I plan to tackle more complex projects and explore new applications of Python. I encourage anyone interested in programming to take on their own projects and push the limits of their knowledge and skills. By applying what we learn in online courses and tutorials to real-world scenarios, we can gain valuable experience and contribute to the ever-expanding world of programming.
