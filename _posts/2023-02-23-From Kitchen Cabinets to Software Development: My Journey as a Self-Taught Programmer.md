Growing up, I had no formal training in computer science or programming. In fact, I started my professional career in the business of kitchen cabinets. However, my role in the company required me to interact with many technologies both at the factory and at the headquarters. This exposure to technology sparked my interest in programming, and I decided to teach myself how to code. In this post, I'll share my journey as a self-taught programmer and how it led me to become a software developer.

## Early Days

I started my programming journey by tinkering with HTML and CSS, building simple web pages and learning about the basics of web development. I then moved on to learning JavaScript and jQuery, which allowed me to add interactivity to my web pages. As my skills improved, I began exploring more advanced topics such as server-side programming and databases.

## Transition to Software Development

After several years of self-teaching, I decided to pursue a career in software development. I enrolled in online courses and bootcamps to gain more structured and comprehensive knowledge of programming languages and frameworks such as Python, Django, and React. Through these programs, I was able to build more complex applications and work on real-world projects.

## Applying My Skills

As I continued to improve my programming skills, I found that my background in kitchen cabinets was actually quite helpful. My previous job required me to work with a variety of technologies, including CNC machines, CAD software, and inventory management systems. This experience gave me a unique perspective on how software can improve and streamline manufacturing processes. As a software developer, I was able to apply this knowledge to build custom tools and applications for the factory.

## Conclusion:
My journey as a self-taught programmer has been challenging, but also rewarding. I've been able to learn a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, and have applied my skills to a variety of industries. For anyone interested in learning programming, I encourage you to start small and build your way up. With the abundance of online resources and communities available today, there's never been a better time to learn how to code.
